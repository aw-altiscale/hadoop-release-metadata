* [TEZ-2679](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/TEZ-2679) | *Major* | **Admin forms of launch env settings**

TEZ-2679 introduced new admin configuration (tez.am.launch.cluster-default.env, tez.task.launch.cluster-default.env) settings. The settings will be merged per environment variable and environment variables specified in both admin setting and user override will merged in the following manner (assuming linux classpath here, but works for other OS's).

* [TEZ-2909](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/TEZ-2909) | *Major* | **Tez UI: Application link in All DAGs table is disable when applicationhistory is unavailable.**

Thanks you [~hitesh]
Committed to both master and branch-0.7.

* [TEZ-2949](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/TEZ-2949) | *Major* | **Allow duplicate dag names within session for Tez**

In earlier versions of Tez, DAG submissions to a Tez AM were rejected if the dagName was not unique for that Tez session/application. After this change, the uniqueness constraint for the dagName is no longer enforced.

* [TEZ-2914](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/TEZ-2914) | *Major* | **Ability to limit vertex concurrency**

Added new vertex level config "tez.am.vertex.max-task-concurrency" that can be set using the per vertex conf API to limit the task concurrency of a given vertex.
