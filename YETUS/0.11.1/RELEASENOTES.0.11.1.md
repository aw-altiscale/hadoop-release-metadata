* [YETUS-915](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YETUS-915) | *Critical* | **Update GitHub vote emojis for usability by color blind folks**

<!-- markdown -->

When configured to use emoji for plugin votes when posting feedback to GitHub, Yetus now ensures that those emojis have different shapes to designate meaning instead of just color differences.

This change should allow users who have color-blindness to differentiate between meanings while scanning the result column.
