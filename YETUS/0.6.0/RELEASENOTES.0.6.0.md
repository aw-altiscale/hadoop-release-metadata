<!-- markdown -->

The Yetus Test Patch plugin for parsing JUnit results, `junit`, now accepts two cli options:

* `--junit-test-output` location relative to module directory to search for junit results.
* `--junit-test-prefix` package name to strip off of tests

See the cli help via `test-patch --plugin=junit --help` for more information, defaults, etc.

The exemplar personality for Apache Hadoop now has options to define an installation prefix for the isal, openssl, and snappy libraries used in its building of native artifacts.
