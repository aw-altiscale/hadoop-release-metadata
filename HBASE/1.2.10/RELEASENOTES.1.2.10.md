* [HBASE-21387](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-21387) | *Major* | **Race condition surrounding in progress snapshot handling in snapshot cache leads to loss of snapshot files**

To prevent race condition between in progress snapshot (performed by TakeSnapshotHandler) and HFileCleaner which results in data loss, this JIRA introduced mutual exclusion between taking snapshot and running HFileCleaner. That is, at any given moment, either some snapshot can be taken or, HFileCleaner checks hfiles which are not referenced, but not both can be running.

...
hbase(main):001:0\> @shell.hbase.configuration.get("hbase.zookeeper.quorum")
=\> "ZK0.remote.cluster.example.org,ZK1.remote.cluster.example.org,ZK2.remote.cluster.example.org"
hbase(main):002:0\> @shell.hbase.configuration.get("raining")
=\> "false"
