# Apache HBase  1.4.8 Release Notes

These release notes cover new developer and user-facing incompatibilities, important issues, features, and major improvements.

* [HBASE-21158](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-21158) | *Critical* | **Empty qualifier cell should not be returned if it does not match QualifierFilter**

<!-- markdown -->

Scans that make use of `QualifierFilter` previously would erroneously return both columns with an empty qualifier along with those that matched. After this change that behavior has changed to only return those columns that match.

* [HBASE-20734](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-20734) | *Major* | **Colocate recovered edits directory with hbase.wal.dir**

Previously the recovered.edits directory was under the root directory. This JIRA moves the recovered.edits directory to be under the hbase.wal.dir if set. It also adds a check for any recovered.edits found under the root directory for backwards compatibility. This gives improvements when a faster media(like SSD) or more local FileSystem is used for the hbase.wal.dir than the root dir.
