# Apache HBase  1.4.6 Release Notes

These release notes cover new developer and user-facing incompatibilities, important issues, features, and major improvements.

* [HBASE-20723](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-20723) | *Critical* | **Custom hbase.wal.dir results in data loss because we write recovered edits into a different place than where the recovering region server looks for them**

Previously custom hbase.wal.dir, which is not on the same filesystem as hbase rootdir, results in data loss because we write recovered edits into a different place than where the recovering region server looks for them. This is fixed by retrieving actual recovered edits from the correct location.

* [HBASE-20884](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-20884) | *Major* | **Replace usage of our Base64 implementation with java.util.Base64**

Class org.apache.hadoop.hbase.util.Base64 has been removed in it's entirety from HBase 2+. In HBase 1, unused methods have been removed from the class and the audience was changed from  Public to Private. This class was originally intended as an internal utility class that could be used externally but thinking since changed; these classes should not have been advertised as public to end-users.

This represents an incompatible change for users who relied on this implementation. An alternative implementation for affected clients is available at java.util.Base64 when using Java 8 or newer; be aware, it may encode/decode differently. For clients seeking to restore this specific implementation, it is available in the public domain for download at http://iharder.sourceforge.net/current/java/base64/

* [HBASE-20401](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-20401) | *Minor* | **Make \`MAX\_WAIT\` and \`waitIfNotFinished\` in CleanerContext configurable**

When oldwals (and hfile) cleaner cleans stale wals (and hfiles), it will periodically check and wait the clean results from filesystem, the total wait time will be no more than a max time.

The periodically wait and check configurations are hbase.oldwals.cleaner.thread.check.interval.msec (default is 500 ms) and hbase.regionserver.hfilecleaner.thread.check.interval.msec (default is 1000 ms). 

Meanwhile, The max time configurations are hbase.oldwals.cleaner.thread.timeout.msec and hbase.regionserver.hfilecleaner.thread.timeout.msec, they are set to 60 seconds by default.

All support dynamic configuration.

e.g. in the oldwals cleaning scenario, one may consider tuning hbase.oldwals.cleaner.thread.timeout.msec and hbase.oldwals.cleaner.thread.check.interval.msec 

1. While deleting a oldwal never complete (strange but possible), then delete file task needs to wait for a max of 60 seconds. Here, 60 seconds might be too long, or the opposite way is to increase more than 60 seconds in the use cases of slow file delete. 
2. The check and wait of a file delete is set to default in the period of 500 milliseconds, one might want to tune this checking period to a short interval to check more frequently or to a longer interval to avoid checking too often to manage their delete file task checking period (the longer interval may be use to avoid checking too fast while using a high latency storage).
