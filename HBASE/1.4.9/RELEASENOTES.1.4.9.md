* [HBASE-21185](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-21185) | *Minor* | **WALPrettyPrinter: Additional useful info to be printed by wal printer tool, for debugability purposes**

This adds two extra features to WALPrettyPrinter tool:

1) Output for each cell combined size of cell descriptors, plus the cell value itself, in a given WAL edit. This is printed on the results as "cell total size sum:" info by default;

2) An optional -g/--goto argument, that allows to seek straight to that specific WAL file position, then sequentially reading the WAL from that point towards its end;

* [HBASE-21098](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-21098) | *Major* | **Improve Snapshot Performance with Temporary Snapshot Directory when rootDir on S3**

It is recommended to place the working directory on-cluster on HDFS as doing so has shown a strong performance increase due to data locality. It is important to note that the working directory should not overlap with any existing directories as the working directory will be cleaned out during the snapshot process. Beyond that, any well-named directory on HDFS should be sufficient.

* [HBASE-21417](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-21417) | *Critical* | **Pre commit build is broken due to surefire plugin crashes**

Add -Djdk.net.URLClassPath.disableClassPathURLCheck=true when executing surefire plugin.


---

* [HBASE-21387](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-21387) | *Major* | **Race condition surrounding in progress snapshot handling in snapshot cache leads to loss of snapshot files**

To prevent race condition between in progress snapshot (performed by TakeSnapshotHandler) and HFileCleaner which results in data loss, this JIRA introduced mutual exclusion between taking snapshot and running HFileCleaner. That is, at any given moment, either some snapshot can be taken or, HFileCleaner checks hfiles which are not referenced, but not both can be running.
