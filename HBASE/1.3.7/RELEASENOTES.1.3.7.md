---

* [HBASE-23250](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-23250) | *Minor* | **Log message about CleanerChore delegate initialization should be at INFO**

CleanerChore delegate initialization is now logged at INFO level instead of DEBUG


---

* [HBASE-23874](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-23874) | *Minor* | **Move Jira-attached file precommit definition from script in Jenkins config to dev-support**

The Jira Precommit job (https://builds.apache.org/job/PreCommit-HBASE-Build/) will now look for a file within the source tree (dev-support/jenkins\_precommit\_jira\_yetus.sh) instead of depending on a script section embedded in the job.


---

* [HBASE-24017](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-24017) | *Major* | **Turn down flakey rerun rate on all but hot branches**

Changed master, branch-2, and branch-2.1 to twice a day.
Left branch-2.3, branch-2.2, and branch-1 at every 4 hours.
Changed branch-1.4 and branch-1.3 to @daily (1.3 was running every hour).


---

* [HBASE-24099](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-24099) | *Major* | **Use a fair ReentrantReadWriteLock for the region close lock**

This change modifies the default acquisition policy for the region's close lock in order to prevent observed starvation of close requests. The new boolean configuration parameter 'hbase.regionserver.fair.region.close.lock' controls the lock acquisition policy: if true, the lock is created in fair mode (default); if false, the lock is created in nonfair mode (the old default).


---

* [HBASE-24218](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-24218) | *Major* | **Add hadoop 3.2.x in hadoop check**

Add hadoop-3.2.0 and hadoop-3.2.1 in hadoop check and when '--quick-hadoopcheck' we will only check hadoop-3.2.1.

Notice that, for aligning the personality scripts across all the active branches, we will commit the patch to all active branches, but the hadoop-3.2.x support in hadoopcheck is only applied to branch-2.2+.


---

* [HBASE-24115](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-24115) | *Major* | **Relocate test-only REST "client" from src/ to test/ and mark Private**

Relocate test-only REST RemoteHTable and RemoteAdmin from src/ to test/. And mark them as InterfaceAudience.Private.
