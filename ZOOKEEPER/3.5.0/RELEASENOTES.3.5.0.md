* [ZOOKEEPER-1185](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZOOKEEPER-1185) | *Major* | **Send AuthFailed event to client if SASL authentication fails**

This patch fixes SaslAuthFailTest.testBadSaslAuthNotifiesWatch() to test for the AuthFailed event : previously, the test was incorrectly not testing for this event.

It also removes the testBadSaslAuthNotifiesWatch() method from the SaslAuthTest class : this method belongs in SaslAuthFailTest, not SaslAuthTest. The former tests unsuccessful SASL authentication; the latter, successful SASL authentication.

* [ZOOKEEPER-1181](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZOOKEEPER-1181) | *Major* | **Fix problems with Kerberos TGT renewal**

-Fixes two findbugs warnings related to holding a lock while sleeping.
-Addresses Camille's point: merge two almost-identical retry methods into a single retry method.

* [ZOOKEEPER-1149](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZOOKEEPER-1149) | *Blocker* | **users cannot migrate from 3.4-\>3.3-\>3.4 server code against a single datadir**

The ZooKeeper server cannot be migrated from version 3.4 to version 3.3 and then back to version 3.4 without user intervention.

Upgrading from 3.3 to 3.4 is supported as is downgrading from 3.4 to 3.3. However moving from 3.4 to 3.3 and back to 3.4 will fail. 3.4 is checking the datadir for "acceptedEpoch" and "currentEpoch" files and comparing these against the snapshot and log files contained in the same directory. These epoch files are new in 3.4.

As a result:
1) upgrading from 3.3 to 3.4 is fine - the files don't exist, the server creates them
2) downgrading from 3.4 to 3.3 - this is also fine as version 3.3 ignores these files
3) however, 3.4-\>3.3-\>3.4 fails because 3.4 will see invalid \*Epoch files in the datadir (as 3.3 would have ignored them, applying changes to snap/log w/o updating them)

A workaround for this problem is to delete the epoch files if this situation occurrs - the version 3.4 server will create them similar to case 1) above.

* [ZOOKEEPER-1327](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZOOKEEPER-1327) | *Major* | **there are still remnants of hadoop urls**

Remove links to Hadoop wiki's in ZooKeeper docs.


---

* [ZOOKEEPER-1340](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZOOKEEPER-1340) | *Major* | **multi problem - typical user operations are generating ERROR level messages in the server**

Unwanted ERROR messages in the logs.


---

* [ZOOKEEPER-1277](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZOOKEEPER-1277) | *Critical* | **servers stop serving when lower 32bits of zxid roll over**

Workaround: there is a simple workaround for this issue. Force a leader re-election before the lower 32bits reach 0xffffffff

Most users won't even see this given the number of writes on a typical installation - say you are doing 500 writes/second, you'd see this after ~3 months if the quorum is stable, any changes (such as upgrading the server software) would cause the xid to be reset, thereby staving off this issue for another period.


---

* [ZOOKEEPER-271](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZOOKEEPER-271) | *Minor* | **Better command line parsing in ZookeeperMain.**

There are three incompatibilities introduced by this commit into the client shell:

1) now requires commons-cli
2) get no longer returns stat information by default, however there is a "-s" option that will result in the stat being included
3) a deprecated message is reported in some cases, when the old command format is used. As a result the output of the command may be different compared to client output prior to this change.


---

* [ZOOKEEPER-1562](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZOOKEEPER-1562) | *Trivial* | **Memory leaks in zoo\_multi API**

zoo\_multi API used to leak memory while deserializing the response from zookeeper server.
Completion entries for individual operation in zoo\_multi transaction weren't getting cleaned causing memory leak. This patch resolves this memory leak by destroying completion entries in deserialize\_multi function.


---

* [ZOOKEEPER-87](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZOOKEEPER-87) | *Critical* | **Follower does not shut itself down if its too far behind the leader.**

The value of syncLimit should be reviewed before this change is introduced in the cluster. Since it now detects followers that are lagging behind, clusters in which this was happening will now see followers being disconnected from time to time. This will normally be solved by increasing the syncLimit value.


---

* [ZOOKEEPER-1718](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZOOKEEPER-1718) | *Critical* | **Support JLine 2**

JLine upgraded to version 2.11


---

* [ZOOKEEPER-732](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZOOKEEPER-732) | *Minor* | **Improper translation of error into Python exception**

Client that uses python binding may receive SystemError on session expiration.


---

* [ZOOKEEPER-1771](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZOOKEEPER-1771) | *Minor* | **ZooInspector authentication**

Added authentication for ZooInspector.


---

* [ZOOKEEPER-1509](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZOOKEEPER-1509) | *Major* | **Please update documentation to reflect updated FreeBSD support.**

Update documentation to reflect full FreeBSD support.


---

* [ZOOKEEPER-1557](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZOOKEEPER-1557) | *Major* | **jenkins jdk7 test failure in testBadSaslAuthNotifiesWatch**

Committed to 3.4.6/trunk. Thanks Eugene.


---

* [ZOOKEEPER-1812](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZOOKEEPER-1812) | *Minor* | **ZooInspector reconnection always fails if first connection fails**

Fixed ZooInspector reconnection


---

* [ZOOKEEPER-1666](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZOOKEEPER-1666) | *Major* | **Avoid Reverse DNS lookup if the hostname in connection string is literal IP address.**

Try to avoid reverse name service look up when the connection string consists of literal IP addresses but not real host names.


---

* [ZOOKEEPER-1632](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZOOKEEPER-1632) | *Minor* | **fix memory leaks in cli\_st**

The fix for this issue solves the memory leak spotted in the absence of errors. In the case the completion function is not registered because of an error (e.g., see zoo\_async), the line duplicate won't be freed.


---

* [ZOOKEEPER-1811](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZOOKEEPER-1811) | *Major* | **The ZooKeeperSaslClient service name principal is hardcoded to "zookeeper"**

Adds a new system property "zookeeper.sasl.client.username" that can be used to configure the ZK Kerberos (SASL) client user principal name to something other than "zookeeper" (default) for any environments that use non-standard naming for its principals.


---

* [ZOOKEEPER-1179](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZOOKEEPER-1179) | *Critical* | **NettyServerCnxn does not properly close socket on 4 letter word requests**

Thanks Rakesh, you are right, this error is not happening anymore. Flavio, I'm closing this.


---

* [ZOOKEEPER-1263](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZOOKEEPER-1263) | *Major* | **fix handling of min/max session timeout value initialization**

trunk: http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1581522


---

* [ZOOKEEPER-1408](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZOOKEEPER-1408) | *Minor* | **CLI: sort output of ls command**

The output of ls-command in CLI does not contain the []-frame any more. Instead the nodes are sorted.


---

* [ZOOKEEPER-1819](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZOOKEEPER-1819) | *Minor* | **DeserializationPerfTest calls method with wrong arguments**

Fix DeserializationPerfTest which was not testing the desired scenarios.


---

* [ZOOKEEPER-1062](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZOOKEEPER-1062) | *Major* | **Net-ZooKeeper: Net::ZooKeeper consumes 100% cpu on wait**

Patch described in this comment below:
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZOOKEEPER-1835?focusedCommentId=13848420&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-13848420


---

* [ZOOKEEPER-1972](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZOOKEEPER-1972) | *Major* | **Fix invalid volatile long/int increment (++)**
