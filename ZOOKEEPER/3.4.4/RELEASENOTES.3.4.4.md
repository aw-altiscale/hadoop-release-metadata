* [ZOOKEEPER-1277](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZOOKEEPER-1277) | *Critical* | **servers stop serving when lower 32bits of zxid roll over**

Workaround: there is a simple workaround for this issue. Force a leader re-election before the lower 32bits reach 0xffffffff

Most users won't even see this given the number of writes on a typical installation - say you are doing 500 writes/second, you'd see this after ~3 months if the quorum is stable, any changes (such as upgrading the server software) would cause the xid to be reset, thereby staving off this issue for another period.

* [ZOOKEEPER-1210](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZOOKEEPER-1210) | *Minor* | **Can't build ZooKeeper RPM with RPM \>= 4.6.0 (i.e. on RHEL 6 and Fedora \>= 10)**

Fix buildroot misplacement on systems with RPM\>=4.6. Earlier RPM versions support --buildroot commandline flag, so this doesn't break anything on older systems.
